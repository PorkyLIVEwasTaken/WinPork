## Installation
1. Download the code as a .zip file.
2. Open the .zip file. 
3. Copy the "WinPork-main" folder and paste it in your C:\ drive. Do not unpack the .zip, as this would result in the creation of an unnecessary folder we have to get rid of.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> No other drive but the C:\ drive is currently supported. We're working on some magic dynamic drive support!
4. Rename the "WinPork-main" folder to "WinPork"
> [!TIP]
> For easier access, drag the "WinPork RTE" shortcut onto your Desktop.
5. Done!

## First Launch
1. Open the "WinPork RTE" shortcut to start up WinPork.
> [!WARNING]
> This requires Administrative access and restarts your computer. Save any files before starting WinPork.

> [!CAUTION]
> WinPork is a powerful tool, and can be used to easily make changes that can have negative effects to your computer. Use caution while using WinPork. We are **not** responsible for any damages caused as a result of you using WinPork.
2. After your computer restarted, a command prompt should appear over the Windows bootscreen. If it did, WinPork got successfully deployed. If not, contact us for support.
3. WinPork will ask for you to enter a password for the Super-User. This password will be used to log in as the Super-User.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pick a password that you can remember! WinPork cannot be used if you do not log in!
4. After that, a pop-up will appear, warning you that using WinPork can be potentially hazardous for your computer. Close the pop-up window by pressing Enter on your keyboard.
> [!NOTE]
> Your cursor might be invisible in WinPork in some versions of Windows. If so, please navigate certain windows using your keyboard instead, or use the command "cursor force" to force the cursor to be displayed.
5. WinPork will now ask for your username and password. Enter `su` as username and password.
6. WinPork has now succesfully started! Use `Nogui` to list all commands.
