# WinPork
 A lightweight operating system piggybacking on Windows.
## WinPork (WinPork-RTE)
 WinPork is a simple, minimalistic and user-friendly Windows-based Operating System, available for Windows Operating Systems from Windows 7 up until Windows 11.

## Installation
1. Download the code as a .zip file.
2. Open the .zip file. 
3. Copy the "WinPork-main" folder and paste it in your C:\ drive. **Do not unpack the .zip!**
NOTE: No other drive but the C:\ drive is currently supported. We're working on some magic dynamic drive support!
4. Rename the "WinPork-main" folder to "WinPork"
5. (OPTIONAL) For easier access, drag the "WinPork RTE" shortcut onto your Desktop.
6. Done!

## First Launch
1. Open the "WinPork RTE" shortcut to start up WinPork. This requires Administrative access and restarts your computer. Save any files before starting WinPork.
2. After your computer restarted, a command prompt should appear over the Windows bootscreen, followed by a pop-up window. If it did, WinPork got successfully deployed. If not, contact us for support.
3. Close the pop-up window by pressing Enter on your keyboard. You now have succesfully booted up WinPork.
NOTE: Your cursor in invisible in WinPork in some versions of Windows. If so, please navigate certain windows using your keyboard instead, or use the command "cursor force" to force the cursor to be displayed.
