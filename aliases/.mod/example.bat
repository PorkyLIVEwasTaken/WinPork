@echo off
REM "echo off" turns off command repeating as it is very annoying!

REM This is the main part of the script. Anything can be put in here, and it will be executed.
echo Hello World!
echo You have just started the WinPork example script. This script is made to educate new coders about how to make a WinPork-compatible script.
echo For more information, open C:\WinPork\aliases\.mod\example.bat in Notepad, or check out the GitHub Wiki!

REM Always use "exit /b 0" to indicate the end of the file. Without this line WinPork will wait forever for the script to end.
exit /b 0
